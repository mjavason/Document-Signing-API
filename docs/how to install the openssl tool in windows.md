To install OpenSSL on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. **Download the OpenSSL Binary**:

   Visit the OpenSSL official website's "Win32/Win64 OpenSSL Installer" page to download the OpenSSL binaries for Windows. You can find it here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

   When you're on the download page, you'll see several different versions. Choose the appropriate version for your system (32-bit or 64-bit) and download the installer. You can choose the "Light" version, which includes just the necessary components for basic usage.

2. **Run the Installer**:

   Double-click the downloaded installer to run it. The installer will guide you through the installation process. You can accept the default settings, and the installer will set up OpenSSL for you.

3. **Add OpenSSL to System Path (Optional)**:

   To use OpenSSL from the command prompt or PowerShell, you can add OpenSSL to the system's PATH environment variable. To do this, follow these steps:

   - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left side.
   - Click the "Environment Variables" button.
   - In the "System Variables" section, find and select "Path," then click the "Edit" button.
   - Add the path to the OpenSSL bin directory (usually `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin` or `C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win32\bin`) to the list of paths.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

4. **Verify Installation**:

   To verify that OpenSSL has been installed correctly, open a command prompt or PowerShell and run the following command:

   ```bash
   openssl version
   ```

   If OpenSSL is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH, this command should display the OpenSSL version information.

Now you have OpenSSL installed on your Windows system, and you can use it to generate keys, perform cryptographic operations, and more. Please note that the specific paths and installation options may vary based on the version of OpenSSL you download, so be sure to adjust the installation instructions as needed.
